I will update the dashboard to match the provided image exactly.

1. **Modify** **`src/main/resources/templates/dashboard.html`**:

   * Remove all inline `<style>` CSS.

   * Add a link to the external CSS file: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css">`.

   * Update the HTML structure to include missing elements observed in the image (e.g., the "12% vs. ontem" text in the Faturamento card).

   * Ensure all classes and icons match the design requirements.

2. **Update** **`src/main/resources/static/css/style.css`**:

   * Completely rewrite the CSS to replicate the visual style of the image.

   * Implement the dark theme, specific gradients for cards (Blue, Orange, Dark, Green), and the sidebar styling.

   * Ensure exact matching of fonts, spacing, border-radius, and colors (using the "AutoShine" palette).

   * Define styles for the dashboard grid, lists, status badges, and typography.

3. **Verification**:

   * I will verify the HTML structure and CSS classes.

   * Since I cannot see the rendered page, I will rely on the code structure and standard CSS practices to ensure it matches the description and code patterns.
